# ML_Model_for_COVID-19_Deaths_Prediction
Author: Parameswara rao

I implimented a simple Linear Regression model using corona_cases.csv data set for predicting COVID-19 death cases.This project is organised as follows:
(a) Extract data from CSV file.
(b) Data preprocessing and variable selection.
(c) Analyse Pearsons correlation between indipendant and dependant variables.
(d) Basic regression model.
(e) monitor model summary and results

 corona_cases.csv: data set for model building.
 
 Result:
 1. Observed correlation between those by using Heat maps and got Pearsonâ€™s correlation factor: 0.969.
 2. attained R^2: 0.940, i.e. I can predict daily death cases with 94% accuracy.
